How to manage exceptions from rest api in ASP.NET Core MVC web application. I have application wrote in onion architecture. I have in one solution: 
1. ShopWeb.csproj - ASP.NET Core MVC razor web app. This project has reference to Application and Infrastructure project
2. Application.csproj with transfer object models which mapping from and to rest api models from Domain project using AutoMapper, services with their interfaces which invoke repository method from infrastructure. This project has reference to Domain project
3. Domain.csproj which contains rest api models and repository interfaces. This project has no reference to other part of application. Infrastructure and Applications have reference to this project.
4. Infrastructure.csproj which contains all infrastructure to invoke rest api endpoints. It invoke endpoints from repositories which implements interfaces from Domain. This project has references to Domain project.
Controllers or PageModels invoke services from application. Application services invoke repository method from Infrastructure. Infrastructure repositories call rest api endpoints and send response back to ShopWeb.csproj. Sometimes endpoint return BadRequest, NotFound, Unauthorize with specified message. How to manage this response in ShopWeb.csproj? How to create general module to manage this response and display user in appropriate layout, controller or page where user current used.
